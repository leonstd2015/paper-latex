  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the co-movement and the causality relationship between energy consumption as well as electricity consumption and the HDI (human development index) using as a proxy of human well-being and by including energy prices as an additional variable, in fifteen developing countries for the period 1988 to 2008. Recently developed tests for the panel unit root, heterogeneous panel cointegration, and panel-based error correction models are employed.The empirical results support the neutrality hypothesis in the short-term, regards total energy or electricity consumption, implying an absence of causality running in either direction. In the short term, energy as well as electricity consumption has a neutral effect on the HDI.In the long-term the findings provide a clear support of a negative cointegration relationship between energy consumption and the HDI. While a positive cointegration relationship exists between electricity consumption and HDI.A 1% increase in per capita energy consumption reduces the HDI by 0.8% and, a 1% increase in per capita electricity consumption increases the HDI by 0.22%. Moreover, a 1% increase in energy price reduces the HDI by around 0.11%.This study thus provides empirical evidence of long-run and causal relationships between energy consumption and the HDI for our sample of countries; supporting the assertion that lack or limited access to modern energy services could hamper economic and human development prospects of countries and underpins all the MDGs (millennium development goals).

An exergy balance equation is used to identify the real points of energy loss in the turbine system, which can provide a reference for optimizing operation and conserving energy. Results show that irreversibilities yield the highest exergy loss in the turbine, particularly in the very high pressure (VHP) and low pressure (LP) cylinders. Compared with that in the turbine of a single reheat unit, exergy loss in the studied turbine is higher and exergy efficiency is lower. For the regenerative system, exergy loss is lower and exergy efficiency is higher in the double reheat unit than in the single reheat unit. Thus, the layout of the regenerative heaters in the double reheat unit is more reasonable. However, exergy loss in high pressure regenerative heater Nos. 3 and 6 and low pressure regenerative heater Nos. 7 and 10 in the heat recovery system is extraordinary because of different reasons. Exergy loss in the condenser of the double reheat unit is relatively smaller than that in the condenser of the single reheat unit.},

  abstract = {Coal-fired power plants in China consume nearly half of available coals, and the resulting CO2 emissions cover over 40% of total national emissions. Therefore, reducing the energy expenditure of coal-fired power plants is of great significance to China's energy security and greenhouse gas reduction programs. For coal-fired power plants, the temperature of a boiler's exhaust gas reaches 120-150 degrees C or even higher. The thermal energy of boiler's exhaust accounts for approximately 3-8% of the total energy of fuel input. Given these factors, we conducted a techno-economic analysis and optimization design of the heat recovery system using boiler exhaust gas. This research is conformed to the principles of thermodynamic, heat transfer, and hydrodynamics. Based on the data from an existing 1000 MW typical power generation unit in China, four typical flue gas heat recovery schemes are quantitatively analyzed from the thermodynamics perspective. The impacts of flue gas heat recovery on net work output and standard coal consumption rate of various schemes are performed. Furthermore, the transfer area of heat recovery exchanger and the draft fan work increment due to the flue gas pressure drop are analyzed. Finally, a techno-economic analysis of the heat recovery schemes is conducted, and some recommendations on optimization design parameters are proposed, with full consideration of various factors such as the decrease on fuel cost due to energy conservation as well as the investment cost of heat recovery retrofitting. The results revealed that, high-stage steam substitute scheme of flue gas heat recovery in power plant can obtain higher energy-saving effects than that of low-stage steam substitute scheme. And the energy-saving benefit of flue gas heat recovery, especially with high-stage steam substitute scheme, is weakened by large heat exchange areas and flue gas pressure drop caused by lower temperature differentials. Therefore, the techno-economic performance of the flue gas heat recovery in power plant may not always increase with the increment of the recovered heat but have an optimum point.

  abstract = {This paper presents a case study of recovering the waste heat of the exhaust flue gas before entering a flue gas desulphurizer (FGD) in a 600 MW power plant. This waste heat can be recovered by installing a low pressure economizer (LPE) to heat the condensed water which can save the steam extracted from the steam turbine for heating the condensed water and then extra work can be obtained. The energy and water savings and the reduction of CO2 emission resulted from the LPE installation are assessed for three cases in a 600 MW coal-fired power plant with wet stack. Serpentine pipes with quadrate finned extensions are selected for the LPE heat exchanger which has an overall coefficient of heat transfer of 37 W/m2·K and the static pressure loss of 781 Pa in the optimized case. Analysis results show that it is feasible to install LPEs in the exhaust flue gas system between the pressurizing fan and the FGD, which has little negative impacts on the unit. The benefits generated include saving of standard coal equivalent (SCE) at 2–4 g/(kW·h) and saving of water at 25–35 t/h under full load operation with corresponding reduction of CO2 emission.},

An innovative connection of the new additional economizer was applied. It is in parallel connection to the first section of the originally built economizer and it is directly fed with the feedwater from the outlet of the feedwater pump. The analysis of Unit B1 operation with such an economizer arrangement is performed and it is supported by measured data. It is shown that more than 30MWth of the flue gas waste heat is recovered. The Unit gross efficiency is increased by 0.53 percentage points, which leads to 9.4MWe of the electric power production. The parallel connection of the additional economizer also leads to the partial feedwater bypass of the high pressure heaters, which enables an increase of the plant electric power by up to 24.5MWe. The accompanying effects are the reduction of the pressure drop in the feedwater line and the economizers, which leads to the decrease of the energy consumption for the main feedwater pump operation. The applied solution is presented together with measured and calculated energy and economic benefits.},

  abstract  = {Abstract DONG Energy owns and operates seven power stations in Denmark fueled by internationally traded bituminous coal. Since the early 1980s, competitiveness has been supported by an efficient conversion from coal to wire in super critical boilers and turbines. DONG Energy also operates a double reheat plant with ultra super critical steam parameters, and based on experience from this plant, a revised concept for the double reheat steam cycle has been developed. The revised design (named the Master Cycle or MC) solves the problems with the very strong superheating of the bleed steam from the IP turbines and paves the way for an affordable double reheat technology. The core component of the revised design is a small separate turbine (named the tuning turbine or T-turbine) driving a 100% boiler feed pump in combination with a balancing motor/generator and delivering relatively cold bleed steam for the heaters normally bleeding on the IP turbines. The T-turbine is fed with steam from the first cold reheat steam line meaning reduced steam flow through the reheaters and higher main steam flow which is advantageous for cooling of the furnace walls. Based on the Master Cycle and Ultra Super Critical (USC) steam parameters, net efficiency of a single reheat plant can be improved from 47% to 48.5% without any deterioration of availability. Many double reheat plants with elements similar to those of the Master Cycle are in operation in the USA and their operational records are excellent. Higher net efficiency of a Master Cycle plant would mean solid CO2 reductions of 4% by comparison with a new single reheat plant. Much higher reductions could be achieved by replacing an old plant.},

Therefore, the HRSG must be carefully designed in order to maximize the heat exchanged and to improve the overall performance of the plant. In this paper, a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to simultaneously optimize the equipment arrangement, geometric design and operating conditions of CCPPs is proposed. General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) is used to implement and to solve the mathematical model. The HRSG model involves discrete decisions connected with the geometric design and the selection of tube diameters as well as the length and width of each solid fin. Continuous variables are used to model the operating conditions of the HRSG and steam turbines (ST). The solution strategy for the resulting model comprises two phases: the first one focuses the process optimization but considering only global energy and mass balances and this phase provides initial-bounds values for the second phase where the complete and rigorous model involving discrete decisions is solved. Different case studies with increasing complexity have been successfully solved. Model validation and results obtained from the MINLP model by considering different objective functions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Double reheat ultra-supercritical power plants have been receiving an increasing amount of attention because of their high thermal efficiency. However, the superheat degree of extraction steam in double reheat power plants is relatively high and results in a large temperature difference in the heat transfer process of the regenerative system. As a result, this impedes further improvement of the thermal efficiency of double reheat power plants. This paper presents two superheat utilization schemes of extraction steam in a double reheat ultra-supercritical power plant, where one scheme adopts outer steam coolers and the other employs a regenerative turbine. A comparative study of the two proposed schemes is conducted. Thermodynamic and techno-economic analyses are performed to reveal the energy saving effects of the proposed schemes. Thermodynamic analyses under partial load operation conditions are also presented. The results reveal the following. The power generation efficiency of the outer steam cooler scheme and the regenerative turbine scheme increases by 0.16 percentage points and 0.67 percentage points compared with a reference double reheat power plant, respectively. When the load is reduced, the energy saving effects of the proposed schemes become more obvious. The power generation efficiency increments of the outer steam cooler and the regenerative turbine schemes can reach 0.19 and 0.79 percentage points, respectively, at a 50% turbine heat acceptance load. The net annual revenues of the two schemes are 0.29 and 1.59 million USD, respectively. The results indicate that the two proposed schemes can both effectively utilize the superheat of extraction steam for double reheat ultra-supercritical power plants. In comparison, the regenerative turbine scheme is superior to the outer steam cooler scheme in terms of thermodynamic and techno-economic performance.},

  abstract        = {Thermodynamics analysis is performed on the modified steam system for a 1000 MW single reheat ultra-supercritical power plant and compared to the reference one. In the modified system, all the flue gas from the economizer is used to heat the partial condensate, and total air for combustion together with the rest of condensate is preheated by extraction steam from turbine. The flowrate of the partial condensate is adjustable to ensure its heat-capacity flowrate equivalent to that of the flue gas in the modified scheme, which avoids the pinch point of temperature difference of the air preheater in reference system. Results show that the exit temperature of flue gas from boiler can be reduced to a lower value without cold end corrosion and clog. The power generation efficiency of the power plant of 48.35{\%} is achieved, which is 1.27{\%} points higher than that of reference unit at the same capacity. The improvement of thermal efficiency is mainly from both the low-grade heat recovery of flue gas by the flue gas-condensate preheater and the small temperature difference between the flue gas and the condensate, therefore a higher inlet water temperature of the economizer can be reached.},

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} Copyright 2016 by ASME. The world's first 1000MW double reheat ultra-supercritical unit has been in operation since September 25 th , 2015 in Taizhou, China. The thermal efficiency at turbine heat-rate acceptance (THA) condition is around 51{\%}, which is the highest among all condensing units in coal-fired power plants around the world. However, the resultant superheat degree of the extraction steam is relatively high, leading to a large temperature difference in heat transfer process in the regenerative system, thereby a great exergy loss. In order to utilize the superheat of turbine bleeds more effectively, we present a scheme by employing an outer steam cooler (OSC) after the last high pressure heater in series to use the superheat to heat the feed water. Based on the newly installed unit in Taizhou, we examine the energy saving effect of the superheat utilization of different bleeds and their possible combinations respectively. The influencing factors of the mass flow rate, superheat, and effective superheat of the extraction steam are studied. Thermodynamic analyses revealed that the second extraction steam has not only high effective superheat, but also large mass flow rate, so in the overall efficiency improvement it ranks first and the third extraction steam ranks second. Although the fourth extraction steam has the largest superheat, it ranks third as the result of relatively lower mass flow rate. It was found that at nominal load, by adopting OSC's to utilize the superheat of the second to sixth extraction steam, temperature of the feed water can increase by 8.1 °C, 3.5 °C, 2.6 °C, 1.1 °C, and 1 °C respectively, and the net coal consumption reduces by 0.73g/kWh, 0.47g/kWh, 0.40g/kWh, 0.21g/kWh and 0.22g/kWh accordingly. Consequently, three possible schemes are recommended for future design: one is to adopt one OSC to utilize the superheat of the second extraction steam, in return of 8.1°C increment in feed water temperature and 0.73g/kWh reduction of the net coal consumption; the second is to adopt two OSC's to utilize the superheat of the second and third extraction steam at the same time, in return of 11.4°C increment in feed water temperature and 1.21g/kWh reduction of the net coal consumption; and the last is to apply three OSC's to utilize the superheat of the second to the fourth extraction steam simultaneously, to achieve 13.9°C increment in feed water temperature, and 1.62g/kWh reduction of the net coal consumption.},

  abstract        = {Double reheat ultra-supercritical power plants have been receiving an increasing amount of attention because of their high thermal efficiency. However, the superheat degree of extraction steam in double reheat power plants is relatively high and results in a large temperature difference in the heat transfer process of the regenerative system. As a result, this impedes further improvement of the thermal efficiency of double reheat power plants. This paper presents two superheat utilization schemes of extraction steam in a double reheat ultra-supercritical power plant, where one scheme adopts outer steam coolers and the other employs a regenerative turbine. A comparative study of the two proposed schemes is conducted. Thermodynamic and techno-economic analyses are performed to reveal the energy saving effects of the proposed schemes. Thermodynamic analyses under partial load operation conditions are also presented. The results reveal the following. The power generation efficiency of the outer steam cooler scheme and the regenerative turbine scheme increases by 0.16 percentage points and 0.67 percentage points compared with a reference double reheat power plant, respectively. When the load is reduced, the energy saving effects of the proposed schemes become more obvious. The power generation efficiency increments of the outer steam cooler and the regenerative turbine schemes can reach 0.19 and 0.79 percentage points, respectively, at a 50{\%} turbine heat acceptance load. The net annual revenues of the two schemes are 0.29 and 1.59 million USD, respectively. The results indicate that the two proposed schemes can both effectively utilize the superheat of extraction steam for double reheat ultra-supercritical power plants. In comparison, the regenerative turbine scheme is superior to the outer steam cooler scheme in terms of thermodynamic and techno-economic performance.},
